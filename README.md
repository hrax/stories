Simple and easy way how to write WebDriver tests - with Stories!

The motion behind this project is to simplify writing of WebDriver tests. WebDriver itself is useful tool but most of the time it requires a lot of writing to perform simple operations.

Tests are most of the time supplied in a form of a user story (sentence). This tools allows to rewrite the story into a test with necessity knowing only the selector of the element.

A simple user story would be transformed as follows:

> User John Doe enters administration site, logs in and publishes new article.
